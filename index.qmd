## Professor at Universidade Federal de Lavras (Lavras, Brazil)


I am a Statistics educator and consultant. I have been a professor at [Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA)](www.ufla.br) since 2015, teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Currently, I am a member of the Statistics Undergraduate Board and a collaborator in the [Graduate Program in Statistics and Agricultural Experimentation](https://sigaa.ufla.br/sigaa/public/programa/portal.jsf?lc=pt_BR&id=1702).

My passion lies in teaching statistics with a computational focus, prioritizing the use of open-source tools and student-centered methods. My research is dedicated to applying statistical methods to solve real-world problems, and my scientific production is largely the result of interdisciplinary collaborations across various fields of knowledge.

Beyond the university, I work to increase female representation in STEM as a founding member of the [R-Ladies](https://www.instagram.com/rladieslavras/) and [PyLadies](https://www.instagram.com/pyladieslavras/) chapters in Lavras. I also coordinate outreach projects that connect the university with the corporate sector and bring Data Science education to secondary school students.

To learn more about my background and publications, you can view my CV on the [Lattes Platform](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3989787989553183) (available in both Portuguese and English)
